| Can you explain how you would design a REST API for an e-commerce application?    | I would start with defining resources like products, users, orders, and carts. Then, I’d structure endpoints using REST principles, like /products, /orders/:id. Authentication would be done using JWT. I’d also use Express.js middleware for validation and error handling. | 7s            | 8                | Backend Development   | 8                | 8.5     | 8             |
| How do you handle authentication in a Node.js application?                        | Umm, I usually just use bcrypt to hash passwords and store them. Sometimes I add JWT tokens, but honestly I get confused with refresh tokens.                                                                                                                                  | 10s           | 5                | Backend Development   | 5                | 5       | 4             |
| What’s the difference between synchronous and asynchronous operations in Node.js? | Sync means code executes line by line blocking everything. Async means it can continue without waiting, using callbacks or promises. It’s actually the main power of Node.js.                                                                                                  | 4s            | 9                | Backend Development   | 8                | 9       | 9             |
| How would you scale a Node.js backend when the number of users increases?         | Honestly, I would just increase server RAM and CPU. I haven’t really worked with load balancing or microservices.                                                                                                                                                              | 9s            | 3                | Backend Development   | 3                | 3       | 2             |
| What are middleware functions in Express.js?                                      | Middleware functions are like functions that process requests before sending responses. They can log data, check authentication, or handle errors.                                                                                                                             | 5s            | 7                | Backend Development   | 6                | 7.5     | 7             |
| How do you connect Node.js with a database like MongoDB?                          | I usually install Mongoose, define schemas, and then use mongoose.connect with the connection string. After that I can create models and interact with collections easily.                                                                                                     | 6s            | 8                | Backend Development   | 9                | 8.5     | 8             |
| What are status codes and why are they important in APIs?                         | Status codes tell the client what happened. Like 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error. I sometimes forget which code to use though.                                                                                                                        | 5s            | 6                | Backend Development   | 6                | 6       | 6             |
| Can you explain event-driven architecture in Node.js?                             | It’s like Node works on events, like when a request comes in, an event is triggered. You can attach listeners to events. It’s efficient because it doesn’t block the main thread.                                                                                              | 6s            | 7                | Backend Development   | 8                | 7       | 7             |
| Have you ever implemented caching in your backend?                                | I haven’t really implemented caching, but I heard about Redis being used for that. I think it stores temporary data in memory.                                                                                                                                                 | 8s            | 2                | Backend Development   | 2                | 2.5     | 2             |
| How do you ensure security in your Node.js applications?                          | I validate input, sanitize user data, and try to prevent SQL injection or XSS. I also hide API keys in environment variables. But I don’t always follow all OWASP guidelines strictly.                                                                                         | 12s           | 6                | Backend Development   | 5                | 6.5     | 5             |

| What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block elements in CSS?   | Inline takes only the space of content, block takes full width, and inline-block behaves like inline but allows width/height.                                                                                                                                                  | 18s           | 9                | Frontend Development  | 10               | 9       | 9             |
| Why do we use React hooks?                                                        | Hooks let us use state and lifecycle features without writing a class component. They simplify logic reuse.                                                                                                                                                                    | 14s           | 8                | Frontend Development  | 8                | 8       | 8             |
| What problem does a virtual DOM solve?                                            | It reduces costly DOM manipulations by applying diffs instead of re-rendering everything.                                                                                                                                                                                      | 20s           | 9                | Frontend Development  | 9                | 9       | 9             |
| Explain CSS specificity.                                                          | It’s the priority system that decides which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element.

| What’s the difference between == and === in JavaScript?                           | ""=="" allows type coercion, ""==="" checks both value and type strictly.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 11s           | 10               | Frontend Development  | 10               | 10      | 10            |

| How do you ensure high availability?                                              | By redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing across regions.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 27s           | 8                | System Design         | 8                | 8.5     | 8             |
| What’s the difference between SQL and NoSQL in system design context?             | SQL for strong consistency and structured data; NoSQL for scalability and flexibility.                                                                                                                                                                                         | 22s           | 9                | System Design         | 9                | 9       | 9             |
| What’s eventual consistency?                                                      | In distributed systems, data may not be immediately consistent but becomes consistent over time.                                                                                                                                                                               | 25s           | 8                | System Design         | 8                | 8.5     | 8             |
| How would you design a URL shortener?                                             | Use a hash function to map long URLs to short IDs, store them in a database, with caching for quick retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                 | 32s           | 8                | System Design         | 8                | 8.5     | 8             |
