# Interview Trainer Mobile App

All the Mobile related stuff goes here.

## Components

The app includes three main screens:

1. **Resume Analyzer** - Upload resume, select role, enter job description, and get analysis and suggestions.
2. **Use Cases** - Showcases different use cases for the Interview Trainer app, categorized for different user types.
3. **Interview Analyzer** - Provides analysis of interview performance with topics covered, topical analysis, and progress tracking.
