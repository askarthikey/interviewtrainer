# Interview Trainer Mobile App

All the Mobile related stuff goes here.

## Components

The app includes these screens:

1. **Resume Analyzer** - Upload resume, select role, enter job description, and get analysis and suggestions.
2. **Use Cases** - Showcases different use cases for the Interview Trainer app, categorized for different user types.
3. **Interview Analyzer** - Provides analysis of interview performance with topics covered, topical analysis, and progress tracking.
4. **Login** – User login screen with email/password authentication and Google sign-in option.
5. **Sign Up** – New user registration with validation for creating accounts.
6. **Google Login** – Quick authentication via Google account.
7. **Home Page** – Main landing page with navigation to different sections (Resume Analyzer, Interview Analyzer, Use Cases).
