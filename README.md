# Product Group 4 - Interview Trainer to Crack that Job ( V2 )

**Problem** - Job seekers often struggle to prepare effectively for interviews due to limited access to realistic practice environments, personalized feedback, or consistent coaching. This leaves many applicants feeling unprepared and uncertain about their performance. Traditional methods—such as peer mock interviews are costly.

**Solution** - InterviewTrainer offers an AI powered virtual mock interview platform that allows candidates to practice in a realistic, personalized setting. By uploading their resume, users can engage with a Virtual Interviewer bot that creates questions to their profile, conducts the interview, and records the session. Candidates can replay and analyze their responses, gaining valuable insights and building confidence.
