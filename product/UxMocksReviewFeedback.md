# UX Mocks Review - Feedback
[ Presented by Team **Tactix** ]

* Landing page is like sales page, decouple.
* OTP based login is good.
* Auto creating the profile page via resume upload + linkedin url is good idea.
* The interview recording analysis insights bot/box in the user dashboard page is perfect.
* Including code editor is a nice touch.
* Resume analyzer - analysis/suggestions is fine, but auto drafting a new improved version would be great usecase for Gen AI.
* Calendar view is a bit overkill.
* Poor time mgmt (timeout for preso) and avg team presence.
