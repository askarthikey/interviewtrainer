# Desktop Wireframe Report – Interview Trainer Website

The desktop wireframe for the Interview Trainer website establishes a basic foundation but requires refinement to enhance usability, structure, and user engagement. At present, the design emphasizes the platform’s value proposition with text such as:

> “AI mock interviews with personalized practice and real-time analytics – everything on InterviewTrainer”.

This communicates the core offering clearly, but the supporting layout does not yet guide users effectively through their journey.

---

## Navigation & User Flow
The wireframe lacks critical navigation elements such as a top bar with links to **Home, Features, Pricing, Contact,** and **Login**. Without these, the user flow feels incomplete. Additionally, call-to-action buttons like **“Start Interview”** or **“Sign Up Free”** are missing, making the design more informational than interactive.  
A strong **hero section** with a clear CTA would provide immediate direction and engagement.

---

## Typography & Visual Hierarchy
- The chosen font (**“Loranthus”**) is unique but not optimized for readability on digital platforms.  
- Standard, web-safe fonts such as **Inter** or **Roboto** would ensure clarity.  
- The color scheme, largely **neutral grays**, lacks contrast and consistency to highlight important sections.  

Establishing a **brand palette** with primary, secondary, and neutral tones will bring visual cohesion.

---

## Suggested Improvements
To strengthen the design, additional sections should be introduced:
- **Feature highlights** (with icons or cards)  
- **Testimonials** to build trust  
- A properly structured **footer** with social links and contact information  
- **Responsive design considerations** to ensure accessibility across devices  

---

## Conclusion
In summary, the current wireframe successfully presents the core message of **AI-powered interview training** but needs better **navigation, visual hierarchy, and actionable elements** to transform into an effective, user-friendly landing page.
